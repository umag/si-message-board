How to run your application
```cargo run```
to start server
```cargo test -q quick_dev -- --nocapture```
to start tests while server is running

Overview of your approach
After Ive got information that your test case expect usage of Axum framework, 
Ive found a lesson on it and followed it top learn how-to work with it, how to
handle routes, and errors, and how simple requests are handled. Also how CRUD apis
could be implemented.

After Ive got assigment, my thoghts were, it should be pretty simple just few 
API calls, a model and controller to implement handling logick.

Brief(!) assessment of strengths and weaknesses

It works, it simple
no frontend, logging could be better

What you would do if you had more time
Add login, and cookies handling, more verbose server side logging, tracing?
Docker image?
